things needed to do yet:
add privacy policy on footer
contact info will go on the footer
ability to add more pictures
confirmation that admin status has been changed
have the store still show old listings but marked as sold/use paypal and stripe using backend functions to do this automatically
implement browser compatability check
maybe add some animations for loading
refactor sales.js
use firebase functions to make a custom email sign up form
talk to spencer about repair specials sales
center index.html slideshow pics or just get pics that are all the same size http://jsfiddle.net/kizu/4RPFa/4570/
