Things needed to do yet:
 - Make it so that each of the store components is already loaded and the dropdown would just switch between what is shown.
 - Possibly have each item have its own page (talk to spencer about that).
 - Maybe add some animations for loading.
 - Check and see if paypal button code actually works.
 - Make the catalog database pages and put an "under construction" on the page.
 - Contact info will go on the footer.
 - Make the policy area on the policy page have rounded corners.
 - Make the store modal thumbnail pictures disapear on mobile.
 - Add sliding functionality for mobile. 
 - Center modal big pictures horizontally and vertically.
 - Pictures after flip are going wider than the div. Make it so that they don't do that. 
 - Fix the text for the email sign up form.
 - Center policy dropdown (kind of did that. I'm going to add the links and then add empty pages to show that we are working on that.)
 - Refactor `sales.js`.
 - Make the remove admins functions.
 - Use firebase functions to make a custom email sign up form.
