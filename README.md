things needed to do yet:
make it so that each of the store components is already loaded and the dropdown would just switch between what is shown
possibly have each item have its own page (talk to spencer about that)
maybe add some animations for loading
check and see if paypal button code actually works
make the catalog database pages and put an "under construction" on the page
contact info will go on the footer
make the policy area on the policy page have rounded corners
make the store modal thumbnail pictures disapear on mobil
add sliding functionality for mobile. 
center modal big pictures horizontally and vertically
pictures after flip are going wider than the div. Make it so that they don't do that. 
fix the text for the email sign up form
center policy dropdown (kind of did that. I'm going to add the links and then add empty pages to show that we are working on that)
refactor sales.js
make the remove admins functions
use firebase functions to make a custom email sign up form
